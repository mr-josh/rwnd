    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>
      Your privacy is super important! That's why this app will
      <b>never</b> send your watch history anywhere without your explicit
      consent. This entire app is open source, and can work offline (with the
      cost of not seeing channel profile pictures).
    </p>
    <p>
      We run a single small banner ad on the front page, served through Google
      Adsense to help pay for the tiny server costs.
